### Abstract
Climate change is a multidimensional phenomenon. While numerous metrics exist to measure climate change, they tend to focus on central tendencies and neglect the multidimensionality of extreme weather events (EWEs). EWEs differ in frequency, duration, and intensity, each with different implications for biodiversity. We review existing EWE metrics and outline a conceptual framework for classifying and interpreting them in light of their foreseeable impacts on biodiversity. Using an example drawn from the Caribbean and Central America, we show that metrics reflect unequal spatial patterns of exposure across the region. Based on available evidence, we then discuss how such patterns relate to threats to biological populations, emphasising how ecologically informed metrics help identify the role that EWEs likely play in biological processes such as mangrove recovery. The framework represents a step forward over familiar assessments using single climate-change dimensions or averages of highly variable meteorological time series.

This repository contains data, code and dynamic figures to reproduce the analyses and figures presented in González-Trujillo et al. paper. It has three folders: 

1. METRICS: contains R files of the 89 file used in the PCA analysis, as well as the metrics used in the case study (mangrove recovery).

2. SCRIPT: contains R scripts for conducting the analysis and figures included in the paper. 

3. FIGURES: contains a dynamical representation of a set of metrics computed in a yearly basis (long-term series). Exposure values per grid cell are plotted by year and season in GIFs. Please refer to table 1 in the main text for further information on metric's properties and computation.
